# Community Led Growth - Sharp Edges

## Ghost Town Community

### **Id**
ghost-town-community
### **Summary**
Launching community that sits empty
### **Severity**
high
### **Situation**
Community exists but nobody engages
### **Why**
  Launched before critical mass.
  No seeding strategy.
  Members don't see value in participating.
  
### **Solution**
  ## Preventing Ghost Town Communities
  
  ### Pre-Launch Requirements
  
  **Critical Mass Calculation**
  ```
  For active community:
  - 10% of members post monthly
  - Need 5+ posts/day for engagement feel
  
  Minimum members = 5 posts × 30 days / 10% = 1,500 members
  Or: Seed 50 posts/week manually until organic
  ```
  
  ### Seeding Strategies
  
  **1. Founding Member Program**
  - Recruit 50-100 engaged users first
  - Private beta before public launch
  - Create content backlog
  - Establish norms and culture
  
  **2. Content Seeding**
  ```
  Before launch:
  - 30+ discussion threads
  - 10+ resource posts
  - 5+ pinned welcome content
  - Responding activity visible
  ```
  
  **3. Event-Driven Launch**
  - Launch at/around event
  - Immediate activity from attendees
  - Momentum from day one
  
  ### Recovery Playbook
  
  If already ghost town:
  1. Don't delete - looks like failure
  2. Soft-relaunch with founding program
  3. Dramatically increase seeded activity
  4. Consider platform pivot if audience mismatch
  
  ### Health Thresholds
  
  | Metric | Healthy | At Risk | Ghost Town |
  |--------|---------|---------|------------|
  | Posts/day | 5+ | 1-5 | <1 |
  | Response rate | >50% | 20-50% | <20% |
  | Active members | >10% | 5-10% | <5% |
  
### **Symptoms**
  - New posts get no responses
  - Same 3 people post everything
  - Weeks between activities

## Ambassador Burnout

### **Id**
ambassador-burnout
### **Summary**
Losing ambassadors to exhaustion
### **Severity**
high
### **Situation**
Top contributors stop contributing
### **Why**
  Over-relying on few people.
  No boundaries on asks.
  Recognition not matching effort.
  
### **Solution**
  ## Preventing Ambassador Burnout
  
  ### Warning Signs
  
  - Declining activity from top contributors
  - Complaints about workload
  - Ghosting on commitments
  - Negative sentiment in feedback
  
  ### Prevention Framework
  
  **1. Set Clear Expectations**
  ```
  Ambassador agreement includes:
  - Maximum hours/month expected
  - Types of activities
  - How to say no
  - Break/sabbatical policy
  ```
  
  **2. Rotate Responsibilities**
  ```
  Month 1: Ambassador A leads events
  Month 2: Ambassador A does content, B leads events
  Month 3: Ambassador A rests, B does content
  ```
  
  **3. Scale the Load**
  ```
  When community grows:
  - Add more ambassadors (not more work per person)
  - Automate repetitive tasks
  - Create self-serve resources
  ```
  
  **4. Recognition Matching Effort**
  
  | Effort Level | Recognition |
  |--------------|-------------|
  | Light (2-4 hrs/mo) | Swag, early access |
  | Medium (8-12 hrs/mo) | Above + stipend, events |
  | Heavy (20+ hrs/mo) | Above + compensation, advisory role |
  
  ### Burnout Recovery
  
  1. Acknowledge and thank
  2. Offer break without judgment
  3. Reduce scope when they return
  4. Add capacity to team
  
  ### Healthy Program Metrics
  
  | Metric | Target |
  |--------|--------|
  | Ambassador tenure | >12 months avg |
  | Churn rate | <25% annually |
  | NPS of ambassadors | >50 |
  | Workload spread | No one >25% of output |
  
### **Symptoms**
  - Top contributors going quiet
  - Declining commitment fulfillment
  - Complaints in feedback sessions
### **Detection Pattern**
