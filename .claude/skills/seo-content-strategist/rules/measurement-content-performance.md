## Content Performance Measurement

**Impact: MEDIUM**

What gets measured gets improved. But measuring the wrong things leads to wrong decisions — vanity metrics feel good while real opportunities go unnoticed. Effective SEO measurement connects content to business outcomes.

### SEO Metrics Hierarchy

```
Business Outcomes (What matters)
├── Revenue from organic
├── Organic conversions (trials, demos, signups)
├── Organic-assisted conversions
└── Customer acquisition from organic

Leading Indicators (What predicts outcomes)
├── Organic traffic
├── Keyword rankings (top 10, top 3)
├── Click-through rate
├── Engagement (time, pages, bounce)
└── Backlink acquisition

Health Metrics (What enables success)
├── Indexed pages
├── Core Web Vitals
├── Crawl stats
├── Domain authority trend
└── Technical errors
```

### Primary SEO KPIs

| Metric | What It Measures | Target | Tool |
|--------|------------------|--------|------|
| **Organic Traffic** | Total non-paid visitors | +20% QoQ | GA4, Search Console |
| **Organic Conversions** | Goals from organic | Varies | GA4 |
| **Non-brand Traffic** | Traffic not searching your brand | +25% QoQ | Search Console filter |
| **Top 10 Keywords** | Keywords ranking page 1 | +15% QoQ | Ahrefs, Semrush |
| **Avg. Position** | Average ranking across keywords | Improving | Search Console |

### Ranking Metrics That Matter

| **#11-20** | Page 2, minimal traffic | Need content improvement |
| **#21-50** | Tracking distance | Major optimization or rebuild |
