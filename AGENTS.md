# Local Workflow Notes

- Symptom: In mixed Windows/WSL workflows, `git status` may show many modified files even when no meaningful content was edited.
- Cause: CRLF/LF conversion differences between Windows Git and WSL Git.
- Fix: Keep line-ending settings consistent and avoid committing line-ending-only noise.

- Symptom: Temporary artifacts from acceptance/testing runs (logs, pid/state files, env files) accumulate and interfere with clean verification.
- Cause: Validation commands start real services/loops and create runtime files that persist if not explicitly cleaned.
- Fix: After each validation batch, always stop services and delete test-generated artifacts (for example `.auto-loop*`, test logs) before reporting completion.

- Symptom: Some `exec_command` PowerShell invocations are rejected by policy for commands like `Start-Process` or `Remove-Item`.
- Cause: The command filter blocks specific invocation patterns even when functionally safe.
- Fix: Use equivalent non-blocked forms (for example `cmd /c ...`) or adjust invocation style and re-run.
