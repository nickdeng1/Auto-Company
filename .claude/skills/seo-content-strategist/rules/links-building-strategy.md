## Link Building & Authority Strategy

**Impact: HIGH**

Backlinks remain one of the strongest ranking signals. But modern link building is about earning links through value, not acquiring them through manipulation. Quality over quantity — one link from a relevant, authoritative site beats 100 from irrelevant directories.

### Link Quality Factors

| Factor | What to Look For | Red Flags |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| **Domain Authority** | DA 40+ for most value | DA < 20, new domains |
| **Relevance** | Same industry/topic | Unrelated niches |
| **Traffic** | Site gets real visitors | Zero traffic sites |
| **Link placement** | Editorial, in-content | Footer, sidebar, blogroll |
| **Anchor text** | Natural, varied | Exact match keyword spam |
| **Follow status** | Dofollow preferred | All nofollow is suspicious |
| **Link neighborhood** | Quality outbound links | Links to spam sites |

### Link Building Tactics Ranked

| Tactic | Difficulty | Quality | Scalability | Best For |
|--------|------------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Original research** | High | Very High | Low | Authority building |
| **Digital PR** | High | High | Medium | Brand + links |
| **Guest posting** | Medium | Medium-High | Medium | Targeted niches |
| **Resource link building** | Medium | Medium-High | Medium | Evergreen content |
| **Broken link building** | Medium | Medium | Medium | Quick wins |
| **HARO/Connectively** | Low | Medium | High | Volume |
| **Podcast guesting** | Medium | Medium | Low | Personal brand |
| **Tool/template pages** | High (initial) | High | High | Passive links |
| **Infographics** | Medium | Low-Medium | Low | Outdated tactic |
| **Directories** | Low | Low | High | Local SEO only |

### Link-Worthy Content Types

| Content Type | Link Appeal | Example |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **Original data/research** | Very High | "State of Secrets Management 2024" |
| **Industry survey** | High | "We surveyed 500 DevOps teams..." |
| **Definitive guide** | High | "Complete Guide to Zero Trust" |
| **Free tool/calculator** | Very High | "API Security Score Calculator" |
| **Templates/frameworks** | High | "Security Policy Templates" |
| **Comparison charts** | Medium | Detailed vendor comparisons |
| **Expert roundups** | Medium | "20 CTOs on Security Priorities" |
| **Case studies** | Medium | Customer success with data |

### Good Outreach Email

```
Subject: Quick question about your secrets management guide

Hi [Name],

I came across your article on [specific topic] while researching
Kubernetes security — the section on [specific detail] was
particularly helpful.

We just published research on how 500 development teams actually
manage secrets (spoiler: 67% still use .env files in production).

Given your audience cares about this topic, thought you might
find it useful as a reference. Here's the report:
[link]

Either way, thanks for the great content on [their site].

[Your name]
```

**Why it works:**
- Specific (shows you read their content)
- Provides value (not just asking for link)
- No explicit link request (soft approach)
- Short and respectful of time

### Bad Outreach Email

```
Subject: Link Exchange Opportunity!!!

Dear Webmaster,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John and I
represent [company]. We have recently published a comprehensive
article about secrets management that would be a perfect fit
for your website.

We would be grateful if you could add our link to your page.
In exchange, we will add a link to your site from our blog.

Please let me know if you're interested in this mutually
beneficial opportunity.

Best regards,
John

✗ Generic (no personalization)
✗ "Webmaster" (dated, impersonal)
✗ Link exchange (against Google guidelines)
✗ No value provided
✗ Obvious template

### Digital PR Strategy

```
1. Find newsworthy angles
   ├── Original data/research

   ├── Tech news sites
   ├── Business press
   └── Niche blogs

3. Build journalist relationships
   ├── Follow on Twitter
   ├── Comment on their work
   ├── Provide value first
   └── Be a reliable source

4. Create pitchable assets
   ├── Data visualizations
   ├── Quotable statistics
   ├── Expert commentary
   └── Embeddable resources
```

### Guest Posting Guidelines

**Good targets:**

- Complementary tool/service blogs
- Professional communities
- Industry publications

**What to offer:**
- Genuinely useful content for their audience
- Exclusive angles/data

### Good Guest Post Pitch

```
Subject: Guest post idea: API security mistakes we see at startups

Hi [Editor name],

I've been reading [Blog] for a while — loved the recent piece
on [specific article]. Writing to see if you'd be interested
in a guest post.

Idea: "5 API Security Mistakes We See at Every Series A Startup"

Working with 200+ startups on secrets management, we see the
same patterns repeatedly. Could share:
- The 5 most common mistakes (with anonymized examples)
- Why these happen at the Series A stage specifically
- Practical fixes that take less than a day

Would be original content, ~1,500 words, with actionable
takeaways for your developer audience.

Interested?

### Resource Link Building

```
1. Find resource pages
   └── Google: "[your topic]" + "resources"
   └── Google: "[your topic]" + "useful links"
   └── Google: "[your topic]" + "recommended reading"

2. Create link-worthy resource
   └── More comprehensive than existing options
   └── Better designed/formatted
   └── More up-to-date
   └── Unique angle

3. Reach out to page owners
   └── Suggest your resource as addition
   └── Explain why it's valuable for their readers
   └── Offer to help update their page
```

### Broken Link Building

```
1. Find broken links on target sites
   └── Ahrefs: Site Explorer → Outgoing → Broken links
   └── Check Screaming Frog crawl results
   └── Browser extension (Check My Links)

2. Create/identify replacement content
   └── Your existing content that covers the topic
   └── Create new content if high-value opportunity

3. Reach out
   └── "Noticed your link to [resource] is broken"
   └── "Here's an alternative that covers [topic]"
   └── Provide value (help them fix their page)
```

### Link Velocity Guidelines

| Site Stage | Monthly New Referring Domains | Notes |
|------------|-------------------------------|-------|
| **New site** | 5-15 | Steady growth, avoid spikes |
| **Established** | 15-30 | Mix of tactics |
| **Authority** | 30-50+ | Natural growth + campaigns |

**Red flags:**
- 0 → 100 links overnight (looks unnatural)
- All links from same source
- Links faster than you're creating content
- Sudden drop (could indicate link removal/penalty)

### Anchor Text Distribution

| Anchor Type | Target % | Example |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Brand** | 30-40% | "Infisical", "Infisical.com" |
| **URL** | 10-20% | "infisical.com/blog/post" |
| **Generic** | 15-25% | "click here", "read more", "this guide" |
| **Topic/keyword** | 15-25% | "secrets management guide" |
| **Exact match** | 1-5% | "kubernetes secrets management" |

**Key:** Diverse anchor text looks natural. All exact-match is spam.

### Internal Linking for Link Equity

```
PageRank flows through internal links:

[High-authority page with backlinks]
         │
         ├──────► [Strategic page 1] ─────► [Target page]
         │                                      ▲
         └──────► [Strategic page 2] ──────────┘

Strategy:
- Identify pages with most backlinks (Ahrefs/Moz)
- Add internal links from those to priority pages
- Use descriptive anchor text
- Limit links per page (equity dilutes)
```

### Link Building Metrics to Track

| Metric | What It Shows | Tool |
|--------|---------------|------|
| **Referring domains** | Total linking sites | Ahrefs, Moz |
| **Domain Rating/Authority** | Overall site strength | Ahrefs (DR), Moz (DA) |
| **Link velocity** | New links over time | Ahrefs, Majestic |
| **Anchor text distribution** | Link profile health | Ahrefs |
| **Lost links** | Churn, issues | Ahrefs, Moz |
| **Competitor gap** | Opportunities | Ahrefs Link Intersect |

### Anti-Patterns

- **Buying links** — Violates guidelines, risk of penalty
- **Link exchanges** — "I'll link to you if you link to me" is detectable
- **PBNs** — Private blog networks are a penalty waiting to happen
- **Comment spam** — Links in blog comments don't help
- **Forum signature links** — Waste of time, often nofollowed
- **Irrelevant links** — Pet blog linking to your SaaS hurts more than helps
- **Over-optimized anchors** — Too many exact-match keywords is spam signal
- **Link velocity spikes** — 0 to 500 links overnight is unnatural
- **Ignoring disavow** — Bad links need to be disavowed
- **Focusing only on DA** — Relevance matters more than raw authority
